This is a database for a company that owns multiple car dealerships. The dealership group, Benton County Dealership Service, sells many different kinds of cars and has a diverse clientele. Altogether, they operate five dealerships and serve a community of 98,000 residents. On average, a salesman sells roughly 25 cars per month. They buy their cars from both local and international manufacturers. They were having trouble recording all of their different vehicles and purchases on Excel, so they asked for help creating a database. The database records the individual cars, customers, purchases, different dealerships, as well as the relationships between them. The database was built for BCDS's administrator.
